<!-- <p>The word you have to guess is: <%= @game.answer.word %>.</p> -->
<p>You have <%= @game.lives %> lives remaining. </p>
<!-- There is a known issue with the below array that is meant to show incorrect guesses.
     duplicate guesses will be shown here as the front end re-renders the view before the backend has
    valided against the input, so you end up with a phantom input that isnt persisted in the database,
    dissapears upon submission of the next input, but still shows up in the first place. -->
<p>Your Answer is: <%= @game.answer.word %></p>
